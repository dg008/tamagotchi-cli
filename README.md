# tamagotchi-cli
This is a CLI based game application which mimics the original Tamagotchi

It allows a player to do the following:
1. Give their Tamagotchi a name and colour
2. Feed it
3. Put it to bed

The Tamagotchi is able to do the following by itself:
1. Sleep on it's own schedule
2. Lose health from hunger
3. Poop on it's own
4. Age from birth through to death

## How to start the application
1. run `npm start`
2. You will then be prompted (depending on the Tamagotchi's lifecycle) with the various commands which are available (`feed, sleep, status`)

## How to run the tests
1. run `npm test`

## Code documentation
1. First run `npm run docs`
2. Then open the html located in the 'docs' folder

## Todo
1. Add tests for src/start.ts
2. Rename 'tests/root' to 'tests/helpers'
